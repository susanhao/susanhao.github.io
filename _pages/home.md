I am a 3rd year PhD student at UC Berkeley studying Cognitive Neuroscience. I did my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at UPenn.
<br><br>
My current line of research uses a combination of neuroimaging and behavioral methods to build models of emotion and face representation in the brain.  I am interested in how these models differ in individuals with developmental disorders such as Autism.  
<br>
In addition to cognitive neuroscience, my other intersts include data science, machine learning, and computer vision.  Outside of the lab, I enjoy rock climbing and hiking in Berkeley.
