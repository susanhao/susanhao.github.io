I am a 4th year PhD candidate at UC Berkeley studying Cognitive Neuroscience. I did my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at UPenn.  I have industry experience working with machine learning and explainable AI.  I additionally have experience in deep learning and computer vision.
<br><br>
My current line of work in grad school applies machine learning frameworks to cognitive neuroscience research.  More specifically, I use a combination of neuroimaging and behavioral methods to build encoding models of emotion and face representation in the brain. Outside of research, I also enjoy rock climbing and hiking around the bay area.
